# Expert Delphi
This is the code repository for [Expert Delphi](https://www.packtpub.com/application-development/expert-delphi?utm_source=github&utm_medium=repository&utm_campaign=9781786460165), published by [Packt](https://www.packtpub.com/?utm_source=github). It contains all the supporting project files necessary to work through the book from start to finish.
## About the Book
Delphi is the most powerful Object Pascal IDE and component library for cross-platform native app development. It enables building natively compiled, blazingly fast apps for all major platforms including Android, iOS, Windows, Mac, and Linux.


## Instructions and Navigation
All of the code is organized into folders. Each folder starts with a number followed by the application name. For example, Chapter02.

Chapters 1 to 10 have code files
"The Road Ahead" does not have any code files.

The code will look like the following:
```
Application.Initialize;
Application.CreateForm(TFormMain, FormMain);
Application.CreateForm(TFormSettings, FormSettings);
Application.Run;
```

You are expected to have a basic knowledge of Delphi and an interest in building crossplatform mobile apps for Android and iOS. 
The Delphi IDE is a Windows program, so you will need a physical or virtual Windows installation. In order to develop for iOS, you will need a Mac computer. You will also need an Enterprise or Architect license for Delphi itself. In the beginning of the first chapter of this book, we cover the installation process of Delphi in a great detail.
